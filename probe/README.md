Plug-n-Hack content probe
====

Content probe is javascript that can be injected into a content document to expose functionality to a tool.

The source is split into several source files for convenience and readibility. You may want to combine them for
convenient injection; a python script for doing just that is included (combine.py).

To run this, simply cd to the probe/src directory and do this:

```
python combine.py
```

License is the BSD License - just because I found myself using bits of
Firebug (which is under the BSD License).
